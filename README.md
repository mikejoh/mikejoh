### Hi! :wave: 

My name is Mikael and i'm currently working as a **Backend Developer (Go)**, in the past i've worked in a variety of roles ranging from Network to DevOps Engineering. I've always been very interested in programming and have always found that part (of any job) the most fun!

 - üí¨ Interests:
   - Programming and hacking away on things!
   - Backend development in Go
   - Kubernetes

   - :cloud: Native + OSS tools and technologies
 - ‚ùóOther:
   - I've done two tour of duties in the Kubernetes release team, during the `v1.19` and `v1.20` release cycles.

_A note on my repostories: All repositories that i've created here on GitHub shall be compared to tattoos, they serve as a reminder of the past. And, as some tattoos, they haven't aged that well but since they're a part of me and my journey i've decided to let them be. :relaxed:_
