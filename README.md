Hi! My name is Mikael and I :blue_heart: Kubernetes and everything related to :cloud: Native tools and technologies. I also ðŸ’™ Go (lang) and write code both professionally and personally.

:question: About me:
  - I'm from :sweden:/:poland:.
  - I use the :paintbrush: and :pencil2: a lot, i'm all about visualizing things;
  - and i love :skier:.

_A note on my repostories: All repositories that i've created here on GitHub shall be compared to tattoos, they serve as a reminder of the past. And, as some tattoos, they haven't aged that well but since they're a part of me and my journey i've decided to let them be. :relaxed:_
